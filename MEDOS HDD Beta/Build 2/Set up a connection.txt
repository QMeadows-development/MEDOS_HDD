NOTE: this is a server cost, this doesn't pay for your internet connection 
unfortunately
You don't get charged for all the data on the hard drive when connected, just the
current amount that is being read/written
when your device is offline, you don't get a charge, prices are adjusted when the
economy changes to make sure you have a fair deal
Data purchased is stackable for an infinite amount of time

Each hard drive purchase comes with a free trial
every megabyte on the hard drive is a free 100 kilobytes on your plan
example: buying a 512 GB USB drive
512 GB =
512,000,000,000 bytes
the plan you get for free with that: 51.2 Gigabytes for FREE
if you already have a plan going, it will add to that plan, and add an additional
1 GB (no matter what the amount is)

Server space doesn't really cost much, so we shouldn't overcharge people for using it
like a lot of other cellular companies do
However, the prices are still there, as it takes a little bit of power to run a
server like this to broadcast your servers
